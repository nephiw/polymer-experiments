# \<polymer-experiments\>

The purpose of this project is to explore Polymer as it is described in [Polymers documentation](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) The examples are very close to the examples on their site, but I have explored a bit more. They are intentionally simple so that I could debug them and only look at one thing at a time.

## Install the Polymer-CLI

In order to run these, first, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed. Then run `polymer serve` to serve your application locally.

## Viewing Your Application
